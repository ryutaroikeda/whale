whale.rb

whale is a tool for organizing ideas. You write entries with your favourite 
text-editor and add tags to it. You then run whale on the file to filter and 
sort by the tags on each entry. whale does not change the given files.

An entry is text separated by tag-lines. The first line of an entry is the 
title.

A semi-colon at the beginning of the line indicates a tag-line. Tags are words
without spaces. A tag-line can have multiple tags. Tags can be assigned values 
by writing tagname=value. Tag-lines are written under entries. Default tags 
can be set for all entries in a file by putting the tag-lines before any entry.

Set the environment EDITOR to choose the editor for the edit command.
