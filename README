  whale is a tool for keeping your ideas organized. Write ideas into some 
  files and tag them with labels. whale can then filter and sort the entries
  based on the tags. Each entry ends with one or more taglines, which consist 
  of a semicolon followed by space-separated tags. Tags are assigned a
  value by writing tag=value. Taglines at the beginning of the file are 
  applied to every entry in the file.

filter
  Show entries with tags satisfying the filter. The filter is a string 
  consisting of Ruby regexes and operators in reverse polish notation. 
  A regex evaluates to true if at least one tag name in an entry matches it.
  One can further match on the tag value by writing = followed by a regex.
  Options for regexes are specified by writing in the form /(?option:regex)/.
  The symbols for AND, OR, and NOT are &, |, and *, respectively.

  Example:
    whale "/action/ /done/ * &" gives entries with tags matching 'action' but 
    not 'done'.

-p, --paths
  Specify the paths to search. Each path is separated by a colon. Any files 
  with the .wl or .whale extension are read.

-r, --recursive
  Search for files recursively.

-f, --file file
  The file to read.

-e, --edit id
  Edit the entry with id id using the text editor specified by the environment 
  EDITOR.

-n, --name
  List all tags read.

-t, --tags tags
  Show the values of the given tags.

-s, --sort tag
  Sort the entries by the given tag value.

-w, --write
  Write the entries, including title, body, and tags, to stdout.

-v, --version
  Show the version number.

-d, --debug
  Set the logging level to debug.

Environment
  EDITOR
    The editor for the edit command.

  WHALEPATH
    A colon separated list of default paths to search when paths is not
    provided.
